This certification grants a Scout the right to carry (totin'!) and use woods tools.

This is a very important wallet card to have on hand at all times when camping.

There is a wallet card and patch available.


To earn this certification, the Scout must show the Scout leader, or someone designated by the leader, that the scout understands the responsibility to do the following:

Read and understand woods tools use and safety rules from the Scouts BSA Handbook.
Demonstrate proper handling, care, and use of the pocket knife, ax, and saw.
Use the knife, ax, and saw as tools, not playthings.
Respect all safety rules to protect others.
Respect property. Cut living and dead trees only with permission and with good reason.
Subscribe to the Outdoor Code.

The Scout's 'Totin' Rights' can be taken away if the scout fails in these responsibilities.

(In some troops, a corner is removed from the wallet card for each minor infraction. When all four corners are gone, the scout loses these totin' rights.)

The Totin' Chip patch is considered a 'temporary' patch and should only be displayed on the uniform centered on the right pocket, 
or hung in a temporary patch holder from the right pocket button. It does NOT get permanently sewn on a pocket flap even though it is shaped that way.
You may want to check with your BSA council for local guidelines.
