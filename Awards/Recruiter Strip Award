Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts may earn the Recruiter Strip by recruiting other youth to join scouts.

The strip is worn centered directly below the right pocket on the uniform.

There are no formal requirements for these strips. Each Council establishes the procedure for awarding the strip, so please check with your local council office or unit leader.

Usually, a Recruiter Strip is awarded to a Cub Scout or Boy Scout the first time the scout recruits a friend, relative, classmate, or other acquaintance to join.

Normally, one strip can be awarded to a scout while a Cub Scout and another while the scout is a Boy Scout if the scout recruits at both levels.
